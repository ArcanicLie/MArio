# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Power Up (title work in progress)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A mario game focusing on power ups and enemies from different mario games.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In my project i hope to implement different power up that they had implemented in previous mario games (like the mini and mega shroom). I hope to see how they interact with the enviroment and enemies. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be at least one of the power ups working and being able to die by the enemies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In an ideal world two or more power ups would work.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In the best world bowser would be there. (specifically voiced by jack black Oh well)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would need to focus on figuring out how to implement powerups so i would need to do some reasearch on how such code interacts with what i want, Peferebly i would need to find out what power ups i want and how they work and what enemies exist in the mario games and the behavour works. It should be interesting to find out.
